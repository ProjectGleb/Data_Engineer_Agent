# COGNITO Example:
# data = {"contigou_features": "AI Features Cognito wants: Personalised learning journey: AI will suggest the best activities to do (e.g., which lesson, quiz, FC deck, etc.), and the plan will update as students complete activities and answer questions correctly or incorrectly. Students can enter information such as dates and topics of a particular mock, and the AI plan will adapt accordingly. Adaptive learning streams: AI will update lessons, quizzes, etc., based on student performance. For example, if a student answers a question on the definition of osmosis incorrectly, theyâ€™ll be given a similar question later in the lesson, but with slight variations (e.g., different missing words). Chatbot / AI tutor: A chatbot that can answer specific questions about the course (e.g., what is the definition of diffusion), ideally pulling content from our content library rather than being entirely bespoke. 1 Marking longer Qs (automated marking): AI could mark longer written questions, suggesting which marks the student earned and providing bespoke feedback on how they could improve or clarifying their misunderstandings. AI content creation: We already use GPT-4 and Claude to generate revision notes, questions, and flashcards, and we aim to enhance this process to improve quality and reduce the manual input required from our content writers",
#          "url2": "Background info: 4th Nov 2023. Reading time: 10 min The idea of this page is to give you some background to Cognito and our users. Let me know if there is anything else that could be helpful. Cognito past, present and future (link) The above link is an overview of what we've done so far, and our future plans. It was written for new employees to understand what we're up to. --- ### Problem & value proposition Problem Students have to learn a lot of material and take exams. They have to use a variety of mediocre resources in order to get by. Value proposition Cognito provides an all in one solution that takes students from learning new material all the way to being exam ready for all 3 sciences. Cognito resources are more efficient, more engaging, comprehensive. --- ### Difficulties students face in finding resources - There is an abundance of resources for students to choose between, but most of them are: - Poorly written - Not comprehensive - Behind a paywall - Boring - It is hard for students to find resources that are specific to their: - Course (e.g. Biology AQA, Triple, Higher Tier) - This is particularly problematic as students often end up using the wrong materials and learning things they don't need to know, while missing out on things they do need to know. To give a sense of this, there are are 20-30 different GCSE biology courses. - Subject (e.g. Biology or chemistry) - Level (e.g. GCSE or A-level) - Student require a number of different resources for each stage of their learning journey: - Learning - textbooks, videos, classes - Revision/practise - revision guides, flashcards, question books - Exam technique - not really taught, indirectly from exam paper answers - Exam prep - past exam papers - Overall, students end up using a variety of resources of varying quality. As a result there is no central resource where they can visualise their courses and their current progress. The resources they use also aren't consistent with each other, personalised, or utilising any kind of gamification. - Having to navigate between so many different resources creates a lot of friction and saps motivation as they aren't really sure if they're doing it right. --- ### Target audience - Students - primary target is high schools students (currently 14-16, but soon to be 11-18) - Teachers - secondary target is teachers as they use cognito in the classroom and spread it to students - Parents - parents are only an audience in so far as they will generally be the ones paying --- ### User journey 1. Discovery Phase: - A GCSE student stumbles upon Cognito through a YouTube video, peer recommendation, their teacher's suggestion, or an online search. 2. Trial Usage: - They explore the platform's free resources, recognising their value for GCSE revision but are unable to save their progress. 3. Sign-Up: - To overcome this, the student registers for a free account, which allows progress tracking. 4. Encountering Limits: - As the student delves deeper into their revision, they reach the limit of flashcards, quiz, or exam questions offered in the free tier. 5. Committing to Pro: - Realising the benefits of unlimited flashcards and advanced features, the student opts for a Pro subscription to fully support their GCSE exam preparation. ### Sample user persona (and journey) - Student ### User Persona: Alex Demographics: - Age: 15 - Occupation: Year 11 Student - Location: London, UK - Education: Currently in GCSE study year Psychographics: - Motivated to perform well in his GCSEs and secure a place in a reputable sixth form. - Enjoys learning through interactive and visual means due to a kinetic and visual learning style. - Values a platform that can track his progress and highlight areas that need improvement. Goals: - To find a reliable and effective revision resource for his upcoming GCSE science exams. - To enhance his understanding of complex science topics through engaging, visual content.

Action Steps: - Creates a free account to save his progress and make personalized revision more efficient. 3. Adoption (Usage): - Alex uses the platform for revision regularly, finding the quizzes helpful to identify areas for improvement. - As he approaches the free limit of questions, he considers the benefits of the pro version. Action Steps: - Upgrades to the pro version to unlock unlimited questions and additional resources. 4. Engagement: - Alex integrates Cognito Education into his daily revision schedule, utilizing the resources for efficient and targeted revision. - Engages with the platform by taking quizzes, watching videos, and reviewing modules on various science topics.

We want to expand more internationally. - Google analytics Show Image - Socioeconomic Status: Varied across the entire spectrum, but mainly students in developed nations. --- ### Behavioural aspects - Daily Usage Patterns: Highest in the evenings. Lowest Friday/Saturday. - Annual Usage Patterns: Steady Sep-Dec, rises slowly from Jan-April, big peak May/June, low July/Aug. Low during holidays like Christmas. - Purchase Motivations: Want to access more content to be able to use Cognito fully to prepare for their exam - hinges largely on them wanting to use the non-free content (i.e. FCs, Quiz, Exam Qs) - Brand Loyalty: I think we have quite a bit of brand loyalty, especially on YT and by teachers. If we made the platform better overall, we could certainly become sticky across a students whole high school years and across entire classrooms. - Trustpilot - YouTube - to see comments --- ### Technology - Device type: 25% mobile, 72% desktop, 3% mobile. - Browser: 50% Chrome, 35% Safari, 11% Edge, 2% Opera, 2% Samsung, minimal Firefox etc - Device: 41% Windows, 28% Mac, 28% iOS, 12% Chrome OS, 8% Android, minimal Linux etc We know our mobile experience is not as good as our desktop experience, so mobile share may grow if we improve mobile, especially if we develop an app. --- ### Marketing - YouTube - We have a 550k subscriber YouTube channel that gets 30M views a year. - We mention our learning platform in some videos (but only the minority/newer ones), on the rest we only have it in the comments/description. A lot of people use our YT channel and have no idea that we have a learning platform. - Geography from YT - just compare the relative %, not absolute Show Image - Views across year from YT Show Image - Word of mouth - This is the main one along with YouTube. Cognito is shared among students and teachers - often shared across whole classes or schools at a time. - FB/IG - we had FB and IG accounts, but stopped using them as they didn't seem to do much. - No paid ads - No TikTok - Poor SEO overall - No articles specifically to generate traffic"}

    2. If you are asked to deal with a csv:\n
        - 2.1 Read the file to identify the structure of the collumns and the format of the entries.\n 
        2.2 Structure the data according to the csv collumns, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE LEAVE OUT ANY ENTRIES use the entire scraped_web_data.
        - 2.3 Upload the data to the csv. Do not leave out any entries!
        - 2.4 Confirm the uploaded fields are correct and no entries were missplaced. For instance, the name of the product shouldnt be in the delivery date. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP!!!. Take an extra action to crosscheck if the CSV entries are missplaced. If they are, correct them.""",
